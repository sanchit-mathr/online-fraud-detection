Abstract


Data mining is the process of extracting useful information from raw data. Prediction analysis, a data mining tool, is used to forecast new outcomes based on existing data. The author introduces several methods and techniques to prevent and detect fraud in a timely way, with the focus of this study being on predicting credit card fraud detection. The original paper's proposed solution is based on traditional neural networks, which generate new values and learn from previous experiences. The study proposes a hybrid technique that uses both KNN and naive Bayes classifiers to detect credit card fraud. This hybrid model divides input data into two categories: legitimate and fraudulent transactions. 



RESEARCH METHODOLOGY 


There are three sections to this study project. The dataset was first gathered from the repository. Second, to get rid of redundant information in the dataset, pre-processing of the data was done. Three machine learning algorithms are applied in the third step of CCF detection. The purpose of this research project is to enhance the machine learning model to differentiate CCF using a feature selection technique. To assess the dataset's performance, the NB, RF, and SVM are employed. 
The suggested system's framework and a summary of the methodology are shown in Figure 1.

Conclusion








With the advancement of technology, credit cards have become a popular method of payment. Unfortunately, security deficiencies have increased fraud, resulting in significant financial losses every year. As a result, there is an urgent need for better techniques of detecting and preventing credit card fraud. This paper describes a machine learning strategy for detecting Credit Card Fraud (CCF) that uses Genetic Algorithm feature selection to improve the classification algorithm. When prioritizing the first set of characteristics, the results reveal that Random Forest (RF) outperforms other classifiers in terms of accuracy. The study suggests that the first-priority feature selection strategy is the best approach for a credit card recognition system. Additional feature selection methods, such as embedded feature selection, will be investigated in the future.
